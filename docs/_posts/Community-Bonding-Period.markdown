Google Summer of Code starts with the Community Bonding period where we get to know about the community and get familiar with the code base and workflow for the project.

My mentors and I had our first virtual meetup on 21st May. After having an introduction session, I was briefed about the workflow of the project, and what would be expected from me as a participant. In the meetng, it was agreed upon to firstly migrate the Digit Classifier Exercise, followed by the Human Detection exercise with the necessary changes to the exercise layout and features. Robotics Academy regularly released versions of the Robotics Academy Docker Image(RADI), which are a dockerised version of the entire Robotics Academy.

### To Do
* Find the latest RADI containing the Deep Learning exercises.
* Test whether the exercises in the RADI are functional.

### Updates

* The last RADI version I found functional versions of the Deep Learning exercises was 3.3.5 . I will start working on the exercises using this docker image.
