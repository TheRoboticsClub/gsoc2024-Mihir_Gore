In this week, I held a meet with an admin of Robotics Academy to understand the structure of the new manager in depth. So it was decided firstly, to create a launch file that launches a webcam node.The webcam package used will be v4l2 camera as it is an inbuilt package that comes with ros2_humble. This node will be subscribed by our exercise that will display the live webcam feed. For testing purpose I created a node and tested its working with another python script using opencv. It can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/v3TxNPqANDY)

It was then decided to accordingly edit the HAL.py and GUI.py files; and to migrate the exercise.py's model processing code to the academy.py present in the RAM. I created a new world with the webcam launch file; by setting parameters of Visualisation as Physical. However I faced certain issues and conflicts with the RAM Manager, and the webcam node not being launched. I out up this query with the community.

While the discussion for the possible solution was on, I integrated model quantisation and graph optmisation within the last working version of the digit classifier exercise. It is aimed to reduce inference time for detection of digits using the uploaded model. For this I declared a list of optmizer passes and passed them as a parameter within the optmizer function. I also performed static quantization into a INT8 data type; which helps reduce computational cost. A comparative implementation of with and without optimization tools can be seen in this [video](https://youtu.be/uInX4icuJ2E)

## To Do 

* Set up a basic working version of the exercise that displays live webcam feed.
* Solve the issues with physical visualisation mode
* Migrate the exercise.py to academy.py
