My primary objective this week was to get the physical visualization and world up and running. In the `launcher_world` file, the physical dictionary was left blank, causing issues when running the physical world. I added the necessary contents, such as modules like `ros2api`,etc to resolve these errors.

Next, I encountered errors from Pydantic regarding type annotations for fields like `running` and `threads` in the `launcher_visualisation` file. After researching the Pydantic library, I type-annotated those fields as `bool` and `List[Any]`, respectively. However, there were still inconsistencies with the data types of the internal and external ports mentioned in the file, which caused further errors. I standardized them as integer data types and made corresponding changes in the `launcher_visualisation` file.

After implementing these changes, the `physical_rae` visualization is now in a fully functional state and can be used for the webcam-based exercises.

## To Do

* Add a block of code to the `academy.py` file that will obtain live frames from `HAL.py` and render them using the `GUI.py`. This will be displayed in the exercise, creating a minimal working version of the exercise.
