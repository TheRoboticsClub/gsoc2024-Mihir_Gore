This week I tried to obtain a webcam feed into the exercise. Firstly, I was getting a specific error while running a sample code to obtain the webcam feed, wherein the console was displaying 
"An instance of gazebo is not running." For the same, after meticulous discussion with the mentors, I reached upon the following remedy : 
* Remove all the instances with the GUI file wherein we are possibly accessing gazebo. I found out that we were calculating th real time factor which is utlised by gazebo usually; which we aren't in our case. So I removed all the instances of real_time_factor or rtf from the GUI file. 

Another issue was mismatched topics of subscriber and publishers in launch files and HAL.py files, which I corrected them to the same v4l2_camera_node.

Another possible issue that was observed was that the physic_ rae visualisation type was not included in the launch of the gui_ server in the manager.py. This was resolved by adding an entry of the physic_ rae visualisation along with the gazebo_ rae visualisation.
