My primary objective this week was to create a minimal working model of the exercise that displays the webcam output. To achieve this, I first added an academy.py file to the code directory inside the python-template directory. This file contained simple code to obtain the image from the HAL file and display it using the GUI file.

The next steps involved making necessary changes to the HAL and GUI files. In the HAL.py file, I removed redundant variables related to the line-following exercise and renamed the node to the webcam node whose image data is to be accessed. I then made adjustments to the GUI file to suit the needs of our exercise.

The next step was to test the exercise. When I ran it locally, the GUI websocket connected successfully. However, I consistently encountered an error stating 'Gazebo instance not running.' I rechecked to ensure the exercise was running on 'gazebo-rae' visualization instead of 'physical-rae' visualization, but it was not. I tried to determine whether the HAL or GUI files had any inherent Gazebo dependency, which they didn't.

Therefore, my next task for the coming week is to discuss this issue with mentors and community members to find a solution as soon as possible and proceed with the remaining aspects of the project.
