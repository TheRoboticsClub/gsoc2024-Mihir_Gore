Welcome to the official blog for my GSoC'2024 project
I am working on the project `Improving Deep Learning based Exercises` under my mentors [David Pascual](https://github.com/dpascualhe).
The project aims to improve the robustness of the Digit Classifier and Human Detection Exercises and migrate their frontend to React <br/>
