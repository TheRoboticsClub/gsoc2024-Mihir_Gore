Welcome to the official blog for my GSoC'2024 project. I am working on the project `Improving Deep Learning based Exercises` under my mentors David Pascual, Pankhuri Vanjani, L. Roberto, and David Valladeres. The project aims to improve the robustness of the Digit Classifier and Human Detection Exercises and migrate their frontend to React.
