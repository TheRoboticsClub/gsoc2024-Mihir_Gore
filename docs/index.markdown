# Mihir Gore | GSoC'24 @JDERobot

Welcome to my official blog of GSoC'24 project 
I am working on the project 'Improving Deep Learning based Exercises' under my mentors [David Pascual](https://github.com/dpascualhe).
The project aims at improving the robustness of Digit Classifier and Human Detction Exersices and migrating their frontend to React.
